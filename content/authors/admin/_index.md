      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor of marketing at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder. I received my PhD in marketing from the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. My research lies at the intersection of marketing, finance, and consumption, with a particular interest in financial decision-making and well-being.
