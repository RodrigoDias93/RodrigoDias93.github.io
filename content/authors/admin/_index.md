## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor of marketing at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder. I received my PhD in marketing from the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. My research lies at the intersection of marketing, finance, and consumption, with a particular interest in financial decision-making and well-being.
